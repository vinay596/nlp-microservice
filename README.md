# NLP Processing Microservice

## Project Objective

Create a backend microservice that offers Natural Language Processing (NLP) functionalities through RESTful APIs. The service is capable of performing text tokenization, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging. The project is open-sourced on GitHub under the MIT License.

## Core Steps

### 1. Technology Selection

Choose between Java and Python based on your proficiency and the specific libraries you plan to utilize.

- For Java, consider using Spring Boot.
- For Python, your choice.

### 2. Library Selection

Select NLP libraries compatible with MIT/Apache-like licenses.

- For Java: Apache OpenNLP, Stanford CoreNLP, or any other.
- For Python: NLTK, SpaCy, etc.

### 3. Project Setup

Initialize a new project with the chosen programming language and set up dependency management with Maven/Gradle for Java or pip for Python.

- Set up a GitHub repository with a clear README, license file, and contribution guidelines.

### 4. API Development

Define API routes for each NLP task.

- Implement the logic for each endpoint, interfacing with the chosen NLP library.
- Ensure error handling and validation are properly implemented.

### 5. Testing (Optional)

While not mandatory, setting up basic tests ensures endpoints are working as expected.

- For Java, use JUnit. For Python, pytest can be used.

### 6. Documentation

Document each API endpoint with expected input and output.

- Optionally, use tools like Swagger to create interactive API documentation.

### 7. Hosting and Deployment (Optional)

Containerization with Docker can be considered if desired.

- Deploy the microservice on a cloud provider or a local server, as appropriate.

### 8. Version Control and Sharing

Use Git for version control throughout the project.

- Push the code to the GitHub repository regularly.
- Ensure the commit history is clean, and messages are descriptive.

## Final Deliverables

- A backend NLP microservice with RESTful API endpoints hosted on GitHub.
- Comprehensive API documentation either as markdown in the GitHub repository or using a tool like Swagger.
- (Optional) Dockerfile if containerization is implemented.
- (Optional) Test cases for each endpoint.
